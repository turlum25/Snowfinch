# Snowfinch

A fork of pwnerblu's ios7resources-ipad1 which restores automatically without using idevicerestore manually. I also aim in trying to make keyboard and audio to work.

This is still not a full finished project.

# Support

Currently, this project only supports macOS 10.13 High Sierra and up in Intel processors only and does not support Linux yet. 

# Known issues

Bluetooth, audio, and keyboard does not work and SpringBoard may crash sometimes. 

Control Center also does not work.

Baseband querying may fail on cellular iPad 1 during restore. (Just patched, uncertain if it may happen)

# Is this untethered?

Yes! This uses the 5.1.1 iBoot exploit to untether it.

# IPSWs to download

[iPad 1, 5.1.1 (9B206)](https://secure-appldnld.apple.com/iOS5.1.1/041-4292.02120427.Tkk0d/iPad1,1_5.1.1_9B206_Restore.ipsw)

[iPad 2, 7.0 (11A465)](https://secure-appldnld.apple.com/iOS7/091-9464.20130918.jozAF/iPad2,1_7.0_11A465_Restore.ipsw)

# Usage

Set permissions first: `chmod +x *.sh`

`./ipad1-ios7.sh iPad1,1_5.1.1_9B206_Restore.ipsw iPad2,1_7.0_11A465_Restore.ipsw iPad1,1_7.0_11A465_Restore`

After the creation of the bundle, the program will automatically restore with the bundle to the iPad 1.

After completion of restore, please use:

`./boot.sh`

This is still broken from my perspective and I will try fixing it.

# Some of the tools used

ipwnder32 - dora2ios

idevicerestore, libirecovery - libimobiledevice

# Thanks to

NyanSatan - DT diffing tool, and some of the diff itself. Also for rc.boot and exploit.dmg, which is used for untethering it.
